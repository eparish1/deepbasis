abstract = {This work proposes a windowed least-squares (WLS) approach for model reduction of dynamical systems. The proposed approach sequentially minimizes the time-continuous full-order-model residual within a low-dimensional space–time trial subspace over time windows. The approach comprises a generalization of existing model reduction approaches, as particular instances of the methodology recover Galerkin, least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG), and space–time LSPG projection. In addition, the approach addresses key deficiencies in existing model reduction techniques, e.g., the dependence of LSPG and space–time LSPG projection on the time discretization and the exponential growth in time exhibited by a posteriori error bounds for both Galerkin and LSPG projection. We consider two types of space–time trial subspaces within the proposed approach: one that reduces only the spatial dimension of the full-order model, and one that reduces both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the full-order model. For each type of trial subspace, we consider two different solution techniques: direct (i.e., discretize then optimize) and indirect (i.e., optimize then discretize). Numerical experiments conducted using trial subspaces characterized by spatial dimension reduction demonstrate that the WLS approach can yield more accurate solutions with lower space–time residuals than Galerkin and LSPG projection.}

abstract = {Nearly all model-reduction techniques project the governing equations onto a linear subspace of the original state space. Such subspaces are typically computed using methods such as balanced truncation, rational interpolation, the reduced-basis method, and (balanced) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Unfortunately, restricting the state to evolve in a linear subspace imposes a fundamental limitation to the accuracy of the resulting reduced-order model (ROM). In particular, linear-subspace ROMs can be expected to produce low-dimensional models with high accuracy only if the problem admits a fast decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., diffusion-dominated problems). Unfortunately, many problems of interest exhibit a slowly decaying Kolmogorov n-width (e.g., advection-dominated problems). To address this, we propose a novel framework for projecting dynamical systems onto nonlinear manifolds using minimum-residual formulations at the time-continuous and time-discrete levels; the former leads to manifold Galerkin projection, while the latter leads to manifold least-squares Petrov–Galerkin (LSPG) projection. We perform analyses that provide insight into the relationship between these proposed approaches and classical linear-subspace reduced-order models; we also derive a posteriori discrete-time error bounds for the proposed approaches. In addition, we propose a computationally practical approach for computing the nonlinear manifold, which is based on convolutional autoencoders from deep learning. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the method to significantly outperform even the optimal linear-subspace ROM on benchmark advection-dominated problems, thereby demonstrating the method's ability to overcome the intrinsic n-width limitations of linear subspaces.}

	Abstract = {Closure modeling based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism has  proven effective to improve the stability and accuracy of  projection-based model order reduction. However, closure  models are often expensive and infeasible for complex  nonlinear systems. Towards efficient model reduction of  general problems, this paper presents a recurrent neural  network (RNN) closure of parametric POD-Galerkin  reduced-order model. Based on the short time history of the  reduced-order solutions, the RNN predicts the memory  integral which represents the impact of the unresolved  scales on the resolved scales. A conditioned long short  term memory (LSTM) network is utilized as the regression  model of the memory integral, in which the POD coefficients  at a number of time steps are fed into the LSTM units, and  the physical/geometrical parameters are fed into the  initial hidden state of the LSTM. The reduced-order model  is integrated in time using an implicit-explicit (IMEX)  Runge-Kutta scheme, in which the memory term is integrated  explicitly and the remaining right-hand-side term is  integrated implicitly to improve the computational  efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the RNN  closure can significantly improve the accuracy and  efficiency of the POD-Galerkin reduced-order model of  nonlinear problems. The POD-Galerkin reduced-order model  with the RNN closure is also shown to be capable of making  accurate predictions, well beyond the time interval of the  training data.},

	Abstract = {Many reduced-order models are neither robust with respect to parameter changes nor cost-effective enough for handling the nonlinear dependence of complex dynamical systems. In this study, we put forth a robust machine learning framework for projection-based reduced-order modeling of such nonlinear and nonstationary systems. As a demonstration, we focus on a nonlinear advection-diffusion system given by the viscous Burgers equation, which is a prototypical setting of more realistic fluid dynamics applications due to its quadratic nonlinearity. In our proposed methodology the effects of truncated modes are modeled using a single layer feed-forward neural network architecture. The neural network architecture is trained by utilizing both the Bayesian regularization and extreme learning machine approaches, where the latter one is found to be more computationally efficient. A significant emphasis is laid on the selection of basis functions through the use of both Fourier bases and proper orthogonal decomposition. It is shown that the proposed model yields significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Galerkin projection methodology with a negligibly small computational overhead and provide reliable predictions with respect to parameter changes.},

The essential components are (i) (provably) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations---Galerkin projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation---relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp and rigorous bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound, depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem; the method is thus ideally suited for the repeated and rapid evaluations required in the context of parameter estimation, design, optimization, and real-time control. }},

	Abstract = {This report has two main goals. First, it numerically investigates three velocity--pressure reduced order models (ROMs) for incompressible flows. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is used to generate the modes. One method computes the ROM pressure solely based on the velocity POD modes, whereas the other two ROMs use pressure modes as well. To the best of the authorsʼ knowledge, one of the latter methods is novel. The second goal is to numerically investigate the impact of the snapshot accuracy on the results of the ROMs. Numerical studies are performed on a two-dimensional laminar flow past a circular obstacle. Comparing the results of the ROMs and of the simulations for computing the snapshots, it turns out that the latter results are generally well reproduced by the ROMs. This observation is made for snapshots of different accuracy. Both in terms of reproducing the results of the underlying simulations for obtaining the snapshots and of efficiency, the two ROMs that utilize pressure modes are superior to the ROM that uses only velocity modes.},

This ROM is investigated theoretically and numerically for convection-dominated convection--diffusion--reaction problems. The SUPG finite element method was used on realistic meshes for computing the snapshots, leading to some noise in the POD data. Numerical analysis is used to propose the scaling of the stabilization parameter for the SUPG-ROM. Two approaches are used: One based on the underlying finite element discretization and the other one based on the POD truncation. The resulting SUPG-ROMs and the standard Galerkin ROM (G-ROM) are studied numerically. For many settings, the results obtained with the SUPG-ROMs are more accurate. Finally, one of the choices for the stabilization parameter is recommended.},

abstract = {Summary A new model order reduction approach is proposed for parametric steady-state nonlinear fluid flows characterized by shocks and discontinuities whose spatial locations and orientations are strongly parameter dependent. In this method, solutions in the predictive regime are approximated using a linear superposition of parameter-dependent basis. The sought-after parametric reduced bases are obtained by transporting the snapshots in a spatially and parametrically dependent transport field. Key to the proposed approach is the observation that the transport fields are typically smooth and continuous, despite the solution themselves not being so. As a result, the transport fields can be accurately expressed using a low-order polynomial expansion. Similar to traditional projection-based model order reduction approaches, the proposed method is formulated mathematically as a residual minimization problem for the generalized coordinates. The proposed approach is also integrated with well-known hyper-reduction strategies to obtain significant computational speedups. The method is successfully applied to the reduction of a parametric one-dimensional flow in a converging-diverging nozzle, a parametric two-dimensional supersonic flow over a forward-facing step, and a parametric two-dimensional jet diffusion flame in a combustor.},

	Abstract = {We present a model reduction formulation for parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) associated with steady hyperbolic and convection-dominated conservation laws. Our formulation builds on three ingredients: a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method which provides stability for conservation laws, reduced basis (RB) spaces which provide low-dimensional approximations of the parametric solution manifold, and the empirical quadrature procedure (EQP) which provides hyperreduction of the Galerkin-projection-based reduced model. The hyperreduced system inherits the stability of the DG discretization: (i) energy stability for linear hyperbolic systems, (ii) symmetry and non-negativity for steady linear diffusion systems, and hence (iii) energy stability for linear convection-diffusion systems. In addition, the framework provides (a) a direct quantitative control of the solution error induced by the hyperreduction, (b) efficient and simple hyperreduction posed as a ℓ1 minimization problem, and (c) systematic identification of the reduced bases and the empirical quadrature rule by a greedy algorithm. We demonstrate the formulation for parametrized aerodynamics problems governed by the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations.},

abstract = {In many applications, projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) have demonstrated the ability to provide rapid approximate solutions to high-fidelity full-order models (FOMs). However, there is no a priori assurance that these approximate solutions are accurate; their accuracy depends on the ability of the low-dimensional trial basis to represent the FOM solution. As a result, ROMs can generate inaccurate approximate solutions, e.g., when the FOM solution at the online prediction point is not well represented by training data used to construct the trial basis. To address this fundamental deficiency of standard model-reduction approaches, this work proposes a novel online-adaptive mechanism for efficiently enriching the trial basis in a manner that ensures convergence of the ROM to the FOM, yet does not incur any FOM solves. The mechanism is based on the previously proposed adaptive h-refinement method for ROMs (carlberg, 2015), but improves upon this work in two crucial ways. First, the proposed method enables basis refinement with respect to any orthogonal basis (not just the Kronecker basis), thereby generalizing the refinement mechanism and enabling it to be tailored to the physics characterizing the problem at hand. Second, the proposed method provides a fast online algorithm for periodically compressing the enriched basis via an efficient proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method, which does not incur any operations that scale with the FOM dimension. These two features allow the proposed method to serve as (1) a failsafe mechanism for ROMs, as the method enables the ROM to satisfy any prescribed error tolerance online (even in the case of inadequate training), and (2) an efficient online basis-adaptation mechanism, as the combination of basis enrichment and compression enables the basis to adapt online while controlling its dimension.}
